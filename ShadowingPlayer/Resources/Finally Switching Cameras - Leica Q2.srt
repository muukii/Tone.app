1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
(ominous music)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:09,660
[Music]

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,400
(dramatic music)

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:39,420
(radio chatter)

5
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,180
(birds chirping)

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:01:06,140
I've been taking photos for around 17 years now.

7
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,860
And I've been lucky enough to travel the world

8
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,720
with my camera.

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
Now for the most part, those 17 years,

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,780
I've spent using the same cameras and the same lenses.

11
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,040
Trying different focal lengths, different apertures, sure.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,520
But I've mostly stuck with what I know.

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,660
It wasn't until recently I picked up a new camera

14
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,700
for the first time.

15
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,180
You know what, I think I'm gonna buy a new camera today.

16
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,180
I went in Rome.

17
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,180
I keep saying that, we're not in Rome.

18
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,180
I feel like we're close proximity.

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,180
It inspired me in ways

20
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,180
I didn't think were possible.

21
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,180
I shoot on different

22
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,180
cameras all the time when it comes to

23
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,180
cinematography, documentaries,

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,180
projects, video,

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,180
but with regards to photography

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,180
specifically,

27
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,180
I very rarely

28
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,180
venture outside my walls.

29
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,680
That's where this comes in.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:31,180
I like it.

31
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,740
- This is pretty cool.

32
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,160
It's really cool.

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:45,840
- This is the Leica Q2 reporter edition.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,720
There's no branding on it, which is sick.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,080
It doesn't have the little red Leica button anywhere.

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
That's why I like it.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,400
It's almost tactical.

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
If you're wondering if I wore a green hoodie today

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,360
because this camera's green, the answer is yes.

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,720
A Leica's have a look to them.

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,360
They have a look, they have a feel,

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,200
They have a vibe, even though it's a terrible word.

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,760
I just hate to say it, but it's true.

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
And what is great about this and challenging

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,400
is that it's got a fixed 28 millimeter 1.7 lens.

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
You can't switch it for another prime

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
and there is no switching of the lenses with this camera.

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,240
And I love that challenge.

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,880
And I feel like it's making me shoot differently

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,840
and try to adapt to make this camera work for me

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,880
and it's changing my work in the process.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,040
And I find that really, really interesting.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,760
I have a lot of friends that shoot with the Leica Q2.

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,340
I can tell the difference when they post Leica photos.

55
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,460
I DM'd a whole bunch of them and was like,

56
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,900
what is the deal with Leica?

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,800
Why do you like it so much?

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,320
And a lot of them had the same answer.

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,440
It just looks different.

60
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,840
It's got a vibe to it.

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,060
It's the worst word in 2022, vibe.

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,480
(grunts)

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
But it does.

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,940
There's a look to this camera

65
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,140
that I can't quite put my finger on.

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,040
Matti and I were reviewing a ton of the shots

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,900
that I got in Tofino this last week.

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,820
And we were both standing there

69
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,440
looking at the laptop screen thinking,

70
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,260
what is different about?

71
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,300
Is it just like the blacks are blacker

72
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,180
and they're deep and true and just they look so crisp.

73
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,020
It's almost a filmic look to it,

74
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,100
but there's definitely a stylistic something

75
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,020
this camera has that I just feel like

76
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,060
makes it very distinctive.

77
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,140
You just know.

78
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,580
And this video is brought to you by Motion Array.

79
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,340
Motion Array is an unlimited download marketplace

80
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,460
for all your video making needs.

81
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,580
They have over 700,000 premium quality templates,

82
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,140
stock videos, music, and files to help you make videos

83
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,260
faster, better, and easier than ever before.

84
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,300
The best part is probably the fact that they have plugins

85
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,540
for Premiere, so you don't have to technically open

86
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,100
the website and sift through things.

87
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,280
You can just use the plugin.

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,820
That makes it super easy to add transitions

89
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,780
and things that other people make through the plugin.

90
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,700
That just speeds up the workflow and ultimately

91
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,900
makes the video look better, more polished.

92
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,500
And you will receive a $50 discount

93
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,660
if you purchase the annual plan.

94
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,980
It's $29.99 a month for unlimited downloads,

95
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,580
unlimited use and all plugins included.

96
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,180
You can get as many assets as you want for one monthly fee.

97
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,020
Or $2.49 for the year for everything that you can do

98
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,120
with a monthly subscription but cheaper.

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,480
And if you subscribe through the link

100
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
in the description below,

101
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,960
you will save an additional $50 off of that plan

102
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,920
if you are signing up for a year.

103
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,440
So that goes to $1.99 instead of $2.49.

104
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,620
Now you can try it for free if you wanna test it out.

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,660
You won't get access to all of the assets,

106
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,280
but you will get access to enough

107
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,980
to see if it's something that you like.

108
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,140
So thanks again to Motion Array for sponsoring this video.

109
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,460
And with that, jump in real quick, this isn't a review,

110
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,260
I'm not deep diving into the Q2,

111
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,380
but more of my experience of how it's made me

112
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,420
kind of change my style as a photographer.

113
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,740
You'll see the shift in my photos on Instagram.

114
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,340
It's like I'm trying to shoot with a more mature mindset,

115
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,220
making it feel a little more fine art.

116
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,540
Maybe that's a phase, I don't know.

117
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,700
Maybe it's the fact that this is a fixed 28 millimeter lens

118
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,500
I can only shoot wide always,

119
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,980
which has produced its own set of challenges.

120
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,540
I wish it had a little more compression

121
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,740
because I love separating the background a bit more,

122
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,200
but that's because it's a 28.

123
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,680
If this Q2 had a 50 millimeter option,

124
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,420
even a 35, I feel like I would prefer that way more.

125
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,020
But the fact that this is like 47 or 48 megapixels,

126
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,760
I forget, it's so sharp.

127
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,280
Like look at Matty's beard right here.

128
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,260
You can crop in so far with this camera,

129
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,580
and that's something that I just never really did.

130
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,420
I know you can do it.

131
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,300
You can do that with any camera.

132
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,620
If you have a camera you can crop, done, sick.

133
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,140
But the attention to detail with not only

134
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,000
the photographic quality but the build quality of this.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,740
It feels like it's milled from a solid piece of titanium.

136
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,000
It's not titanium but right down to the little D.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,140
Like look, this battery catch door,

138
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,020
it pops but it doesn't come all the way out.

139
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,900
You gotta push it again, then it slides.

140
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,800
Mm, I love that.

141
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,260
It looks so good, so sleek.

142
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,060
There's nothing on here that doesn't need to be on here.

143
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,020
There are four buttons on the back of this entire camera.

144
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,740
Three down the side, one wheel, that's it.

145
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,780
Albeit there's a lot of like weird long press

146
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,380
and hold press and stuff to custom function.

147
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
If you get the hang of it, it's probably fine.

148
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,060
Again, I've been using this for like a month

149
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,860
and it's one of those things that you can just

150
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,460
carry around with you and use it on your family outings

151
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,980
or just have it as your secondary kind of personal camera.

152
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,580
I haven't done that for so long, so long.

153
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,380
I've been shooting with the same gear for 15 years

154
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,940
and I love it but it's been nice to just

155
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,340
step outside my comfort zone and try something entirely new.

156
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,380
I'm standing out there on the beach in Tofino

157
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,060
taking snapshots of people,

158
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,560
literally trying to figure out how to use a camera again.

159
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,740
And there's something nice about that challenge

160
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,580
that I haven't felt in such a long time.

161
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,100
It's the same feeling that back when I used to do

162
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,900
a ton of magic, you do magic for so long, you're a magician.

163
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,580
Tricks don't really fool you anymore.

164
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,860
When someone's performing for you,

165
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,780
you can kinda just see everything

166
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,020
that's happening behind the scenes.

167
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,840
Even if you don't see it,

168
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,500
you know the moves that were being done.

169
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,300
So once in a while when you do get fooled

170
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,780
and you feel like a kid again, experiencing magic,

171
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,300
like when you first got into it, that's refreshing.

172
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,260
And I feel like this has done kind of the same thing for me

173
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,740
but for photography.

174
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,280
So this video I wanted to make

175
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,220
to kind of share my inspiration with trying something new.

176
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,080
Maybe it's a technique, maybe it's a lens,

177
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,380
maybe it's an entire new system,

178
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,900
maybe it's just going somewhere different.

179
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,720
I don't know, but stepping outside the comfort zone

180
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,560
and away from what I'm just so good at and comfortable with

181
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,560
made me re-appreciate and refocus my goals in photography

182
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
to start trying new stuff, and I'm grateful for that.

183
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,600
So are you switching brands?

184
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,360
Ah, Peter, he's gone, he's like a,

185
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,800
nah, it's just a camera, it's a tool,

186
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
and it's making me see things differently.

187
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,440
That's it, I'm excited.

188
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,700
Life is good.

A ray.

197
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,920
I don't know why I did any of that.

198
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,080
Get rekt, Kirk.

199
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,960
(laughs)

200
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,680
Just added 40 minutes to his day.
