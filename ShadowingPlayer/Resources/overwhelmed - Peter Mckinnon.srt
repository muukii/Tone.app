1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,240
I haven't seen you for a while.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,720
Hi, what's up?

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,560
What's up?

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,400
I haven't done one of those for a bit.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,360
Felt good.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,280
I wanted to take this time to give a little bit

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,180
of a life update, health update.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,280
You know, just one of those little heart to hearts.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,760
It's probably long overdue.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,600
Formula One in Abu Dhabi was insane, got a new camera.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,580
Iceland video is coming, and it's awesome.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,440
Office is coming along very, very nicely, stoked for that.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,720
Travel isn't done this year, still got a couple more

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,520
under the belt to get through before Christmas time.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,620
And some things that have been happening behind the scenes,

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,720
pay, for old time's sakes, to another level.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,720
♪ To another level ♪

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,200
♪ To another level ♪

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,060
Okay, I just got back from Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,400
I flew with my wife and Maddie and his wife

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,740
to the UAE for the Formula One race.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,060
Race day was actually on our wedding anniversary,

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,260
so that was super cool.

25
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,260
My wife's first race had an absolute blast.

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,840
To all my friends that made it happen,

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,660
that got us out there, that hooked up garage tours,

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,580
and made the experience special, you know who you are,

29
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,680
thank you very much, what a blast.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,100
And interestingly enough,

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,900
I didn't use my camera very much at all.

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,300
Actually on race day, I didn't even bring my Q2.

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,400
I usually bring that everywhere,

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,240
it's strapped behind my back,

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,920
but I just went with a phone on race day

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,780
and it felt great.

37
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,660
It felt great to just walk in there like a human being.

38
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,880
I went and I enjoyed and I loved every minute of that.

39
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,460
So, some quick updates.

40
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,560
I bought a new camera.

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,780
Expect a new video about a new camera

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,820
that you haven't seen before on this channel.

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,660
I'm very, very excited.

44
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,860
It's the same color as my other camera.

45
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,620
That's all I'm gonna say for now.

46
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,300
Update number two, this Iceland video slaps.

47
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,660
I had a 25 minute supercut going,

48
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,160
which I think I'll still post.

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,760
It's more of like a big vlog kind of supercut

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,380
of fun moments from this Iceland adventure

51
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,700
that Matty and I went on.

52
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,920
I condensed it all the way down to two minutes

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,260
and we started something new,

54
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,180
which just basically gave us two pieces of content now

55
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,540
that are both incredible, but I'm very, very excited

56
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,660
about the short form one.

57
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,360
So that'll be posting soon, keep an eye out for that,

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,720
but good things take time.

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,320
Now one of the reasons this Iceland video

60
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,740
has taken us so long to do is because we decided

61
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,540
to hand make every single visual aspect

62
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,900
within this little piece.

63
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,740
So frame by frame, motion graphics take a long time

64
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,580
to do well.

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,460
In hindsight, I should have just used motion array.

66
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,340
Obviously time being a massive, massive factor in this

67
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,620
instead of hunting for assets, then trying to figure out

68
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,020
how to use them, how to learn the software,

69
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,180
gets your videos done faster, makes things easier,

70
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,000
but it keeps your inspiration levels high

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
because the longer you spend on a project,

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,340
typically that project starts to annoy you.

73
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,880
You start to get tired of it,

74
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,920
you start to just want it to be done,

75
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,320
you start to scrutinize things, you nitpick,

76
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,760
and done is better than perfect.

77
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,000
I've said that for years on this channel,

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,360
and I think Motion Array kind of fits in well with that

79
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,000
because it gets the project done

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
instead of trying to make it perfect.

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
So here, Motion Array makes sense for the business.

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,700
It can make sense for your business,

83
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,760
and it's not just motion graphic templates,

84
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,600
but it's assets of all kinds.

85
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,340
For instance, if I wanted some text to come on the screen

86
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,780
right as I said, here are some snapshots from Iceland.

87
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,980
That took way less time than you would expect.

88
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,740
Now had I actually tried to learn the software and do that,

89
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,780
that would be hours and hours and hours of my day

90
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,500
for a part of the video that took what?

91
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,380
Less than 10 seconds.

92
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,000
It's the low hanging fruit here.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
They've got pricing monthly,

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,800
they've got pricing for the year.

95
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,340
It's one of those things where when you compound the value

96
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,500
that you get from this, it far outweighs what it costs,

97
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,600
especially when you're thinking about the long term.

98
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,480
So thank you to Motion Ray for sponsoring this video.

99
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,640
Check out the link below.

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,140
But I digress, Iceland is coming soon.

101
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,620
Keep an eye out for that video.

102
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,860
Super, super excited.

103
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,980
Other things in the news.

104
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,740
I'm opening a Pete's Pirate Life shop, downtown Toronto,

105
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,620
at the Clocks and Colors flagship store.

106
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,020
That is opening in December,

107
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,960
so there might be a little bit of a meetup,

108
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,660
there might be a little bit of a grand opening party.

109
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,040
If there is, I'm waiting on a confirmation today.

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,360
So once I get that confirmation,

111
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,420
I'll make some posts 'cause it'd be cool

112
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,220
if you're in the area and you wanna come down,

113
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,060
hang out, check out the new flagship,

114
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,480
check out the pirate stuff,

115
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,020
check out everything Glocks and Colors

116
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,500
have been working so hard on.

117
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,780
I'm very, very excited to have a physical shop

118
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,140
downtown Toronto.

119
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,780
So, very excited for that.

120
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,460
There will also be a small pop-up shop downstairs

121
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,980
once my office is done.

122
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,860
That could be the next point.

123
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,020
The office downstairs, chapter five.

124
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,080
It's coming along.

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,620
Electrical, most of the framing is done.

126
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,460
Still gotta do lights and paint and drywall.

127
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,900
All the floors are done, concrete's been grinded,

128
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,020
but I'm super excited to be back on Main Street

129
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,640
with a place that we can do whatever we want with

130
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,420
and make entirely our own.

131
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,940
Very, very pumped.

132
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,340
Travel isn't done this year.

133
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,220
It's literally been a record-breaking year for travel,

134
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,060
but a lot of it I haven't filmed

135
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,740
because some of these projects have been kind of top secret

136
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,140
that I wasn't allowed to post or showcase yet.

137
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,160
So instead of just saying,

138
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,580
"Hey, I'm off to wherever tomorrow,

139
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,600
"but I can't talk about it,"

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
I just literally didn't talk about it.

141
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,200
For example.

142
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,920
- Don't think you're leaving.

143
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
(laughing)

144
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,580
Don't think it's happening.

145
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,000
- Yes, a very exciting, very quick trip.

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,700
That video will also be coming soon, ready to go.

147
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,320
Now one of the big things is I've been sick

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,280
for what feels like months now.

149
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,320
When I got home from Iceland,

150
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,300
I got the worst flu I've ever had in my life.

151
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,420
I thought it was COVID.

152
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,560
I tested like three or four times.

153
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,680
They were all negative.

154
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,760
When I had COVID, it was literally easier

155
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,000
than whatever this was.

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,060
knocked me out entirely, had to cancel my Austin trip

157
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,460
to Formula One, that's how bad it was.

158
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,960
There was absolutely no way I could even leave the bedroom.

159
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,840
Recovered from that, kids got sick, I got sick again,

160
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,620
and then literally in the middle of the night,

161
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,920
my eardrum burst.

162
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,680
Something I did not expect, I had no idea was coming,

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,540
and I can confirm, it is the worst pain

164
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,340
I've almost ever experienced.

165
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,320
Highly not recommended.

166
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,100
If it ever happens, I feel very sorry for you.

167
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,460
I have sympathy because it sucks.

168
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,780
Now the big concern was flying to the UAE

169
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,420
for 12 to 15 hours with a busted eardrum,

170
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,580
but the doctor said because there's a hole in it,

171
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,780
the pressure won't build because it's already broken.

172
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,620
And they were right, it didn't hurt at all.

173
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,020
So that was pretty stressful leading up to,

174
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,820
I was very anxious, just,

175
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,540
I had an ear infection once on an airplane

176
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,060
and it was total garbage.

177
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,940
So I got to the UAE, just busted eardrum, fine,

178
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,260
but then I started feeling under the weather

179
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,860
once I landed in the UAE.

180
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,580
It's been a journey and I feel like I'm still not 100% now,

181
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,960
but I'm coming out the other side of it.

182
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,780
With all of this, I try to just kinda take it easy

183
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,920
and relax and realize that health is more important

184
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,440
and mental health is more important

185
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,860
than trying to force out videos

186
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,180
when I'm just feeling completely down and defeated

187
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,580
as far as health goes.

188
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,300
Happy to say I'm back, I'm feeling good,

189
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,140
I'm feeling better, I'm feeling on the other side of things,

190
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,900
I'm fired up, I'm very blessed and I'm very grateful

191
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,980
to be able to do this every single day.

192
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,540
Go on these adventures, meet these cool people,

193
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,780
make cool projects, work with great people, and thank you.

194
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,300
Thank you for watching, thank you for subscribing,

195
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,800
and giving me this opportunity.

196
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,900
Thank you for your time.

197
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,460
All right, I was trying to keep this like a quick update,

198
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,260
but you know, I'm not very good at that.

199
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,840
(upbeat music)

200
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,660
Oh, the Angels and Airwaves documentary.

201
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,980
Yes, I'm still making it, it's still underway.

202
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,300
If you haven't noticed, there are lots of developments

203
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,240
happening right now in that industry.

204
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,660
So, good stories take time.

205
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,580
That's one thing I've learned within making this documentary.

206
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,780
It's not a YouTube video.

207
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,640
Things need to unfold, life needs to unfold.

208
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,840
I need to be patient and be there for those things unfolding

209
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,000
to tell the best story that I possibly can.

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Okay, that's it.

211
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,940
I love you guys.

212
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm gonna get back to finishing this Iceland video

213
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,600
and then I'm gonna blow your minds.

214
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,360
(dramatic music)
