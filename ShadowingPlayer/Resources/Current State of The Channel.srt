1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
- What's up everybody?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,320
Peter McKinnon here, welcome back to yet another video.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,280
We're still in the office, this is a different part

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,040
of the office, studio, what have you.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,320
I gotta do a studio tour, I still gotta do it,

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,760
but I wanted to just get in front of you guys

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,040
and say hello, it's been a little while.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,240
I've been uploading less, I feel like I've been

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,200
uploading a lot, I had two bangers last week,

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,520
if you haven't seen them, go check them out.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,740
But I wanted to chime in and say, how are you?

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,840
I've missed you.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,620
Make sure my mic is facing my face a little bit more.

14
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,780
I just got back the other day from the Grand Prix

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,140
in Montreal, which was amazing.

16
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,580
I shot the whole thing on film.

17
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,920
I thought it'd be interesting shooting

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,200
the world's fastest sport the slowest way.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,360
And those two things married together might make

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,220
for some interesting moments caught on film,

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,500
which I certainly did.

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,460
It's pretty cool.

23
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,540
So yes, I am still in love with the film process,

24
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,240
still learning, still shooting a ton.

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,200
I gotta say, of the last 20 years shooting,

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,960
I really feel like I've had the biggest leap of improvement

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,700
and growth as a photographer

28
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,080
since I started shooting film again.

29
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,280
So it's been very great, it's been very inspiring,

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,880
and I've even seen some messages from you guys in DMs

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,520
and meeting you at the race and at the shop here.

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,760
You've also been inspired to pick up a film camera

33
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,660
and throw a few rolls through it yourself,

34
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,320
which makes me super excited.

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,400
So if that has been something you're doing,

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,720
I'm literally pumped for you,

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,740
because it's been so great for me and my creativity.

38
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,660
I have no shortage of ideas for it.

39
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,020
It's just I don't wanna just completely bombard you

40
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,300
with film stuff because digital still exists

41
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,540
and it's still important and it still has a place.

42
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,300
So we'll be trying to balance the two over the coming months.

43
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,760
I was in Atlanta about three weeks ago

44
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,320
at a convention called Blade,

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,200
which is just basically where a ton of manufacturers

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,940
and makers from around the world get together

47
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,620
and sell knives.

48
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,660
It's pretty crazy.

49
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,780
We made a video about it.

50
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,140
It's over on the pirate channel.

51
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,540
We've resurrected that and we'll be posting there

52
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,340
again as well, so there's a lot of things going on,

53
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,360
a lot of ingredients in the soup that we are making.

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,640
A little spoiler alert, we built a pirate ship.

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,540
Very, very cool.

56
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,920
But the next thing I'm very excited about

57
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,720
is I'm learning how to tattoo.

58
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,160
Yes, I'm not gonna become a full-blown tattoo artist.

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,860
That is a lifetime endeavor.

60
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,140
That is something you are constantly working on,

61
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,780
a skill and determination and requirement

62
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,720
and sacrifice for something like that

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,280
To get to the level...

64
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,620
(sad music)

65
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,060
I still haven't beat my high score

66
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,100
and that reminds me literally every eight minutes

67
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,020
that I have not.

68
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,980
I'm nowhere near Andrew Wilson's level,

69
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,780
who is my neighbor, by the way, who tattoos daily.

70
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,900
So I get to wander in and just see what he's up to

71
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,640
and sometimes he lets me tattoo him,

72
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,100
which is pretty great.

73
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,340
But it's super nerve-wracking.

74
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,160
My hand was shaking.

75
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,700
The last time my hands shook that much

76
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,900
is when I was doing card tricks for people

77
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,740
for a paid event and it was the first time

78
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,300
ever doing them live and you're so nervous.

79
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,620
I probably shouldn't have coffee before I do it

80
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,720
so next time I will do that.

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,180
But he just got me this new machine

82
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,340
and it comes in this sick little box.

83
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,280
His friends over at FYT hooked all this stuff up.

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,180
So FYT, thank you very much for helping me

85
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,640
start my tattoo journey.

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
But check this thing sanitizes the machine.

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
I wanna get good at a couple little things

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
that I wanna practice, a pizza slice, a coffee cup,

89
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,320
Just some fun little things that I think people

90
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
would enjoy getting tattooed on them.

91
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
And maybe you'll come, get tattooed by me,

92
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
we'll hang out, talk cameras,

93
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
bang off a couple quick tattoos, have some coffee,

94
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,800
and that would be one hell of a day.

95
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,860
So that is something that I'm working on on the side.

96
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,520
You may have remembered in past videos,

97
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,640
I've talked about having a thing that's not your thing

98
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,600
is very important.

99
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,840
I love photography, I eat, breathe, sleep photography.

100
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,660
It's even more powerful now with the addition of film.

101
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,280
I am all encompassed in this world.

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
So it's nice to have something fully opposite

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,240
that I can kind of practice and mess around with

104
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,720
and learn that stimulates my creativity

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
that is nowhere near taking photos.

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
So it's been really fun and thanks Andrew

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
for putting up with my shaky hands

108
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,760
and letting me tattoo garbage on your legs.

109
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,000
Alright this video is brought to you by Artlist,

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,960
our friends over at Artlist.

111
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,640
The music in the pirate video we just did

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,120
with the pirate ship, Artlist.

113
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,920
The music in this video, Artlist.

114
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,760
Recently I've been seeing a lot of comments

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,000
of people saying, "Hey, we really like the vibe

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,660
"and the feeling and the pace of the videos

117
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,780
"that you've been making lately."

118
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,380
And one of the changes that Kirk and I decided to make

119
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,460
when making videos is taking the music

120
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,020
from kind of an upbeat funk or high energy

121
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,420
and slowing it way down to methodical, instrumental,

122
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,860
stuff that makes you feel, nostalgia.

123
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,780
Those things are easy to find on Artlist.

124
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,200
So if you do find something you like,

125
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,140
but it might just not be the right length

126
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,160
or there's one little aspect of it,

127
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,420
You can find songs that are exactly similar

128
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,560
to what you just had, which saves you time

129
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,700
scouring all of the assets in something

130
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,800
that makes creating easy and fun.

131
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
There are different subscription plans offered

132
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,760
both monthly and annually.

133
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,700
There are pro subscriptions that cover

134
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,120
absolutely everything no matter where

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
you're posting your content.

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,120

139
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,720
And thank you Artlist for sponsoring this video

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,000
and supporting my channel and supporting me

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,760
and the content that I make on a monthly basis.

142
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,860
And thank you for checking out Artlist.

143
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,000
It's very appreciated.

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,960
Next month, I've got a new product launching

145
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,840
that has been ready for months.

146
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,280
It's, yeah, wow, it's probably been years at this point

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,040
that we've been working on it.

148
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,920
At least a year and a half.

149
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,880
But it's, I'm looking at it right now.

150
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,720
It's gonna be great.

151
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,240
Promo's been filmed, photos have been taken.

152
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,280
You will be seeing that very, very soon.

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,880
So stay tuned for new product goodness,

154
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,920
which is always exciting.

155
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,120
Being able to make products is super exciting.

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,240
Physical goods that you can ship and see people using.

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,480
When just that Formula One,

158
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,300
being able to see all the different filters

159
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,440
used by all the media guys from the teams.

160
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,160
Like you're running to the podium

161
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,640
and you see Red Bull's already there

162
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,160
and they've got a guy filming

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
and they're using a Peter McKinnon filter.

164
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,780
That's insane.

165
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,100
You randomly bump into someone leaving Iceland

166
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,260
and they happen to be wearing a Peter McKinnon backpack.

167
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't even begin to describe to you

168
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,660
how proud and how excited that makes me.

169
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,420
So thank you for your support,

170
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,360
and I think you will love what we have coming next month.

171
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,960
It's been a lot of work,

172
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,700
and we're all very, very excited for it.

173
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,580
Not long now, not long.

174
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,740
There's three comments I've been seeing.

175
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,680
An office tour, an everyday updated carry,

176
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,100
but I feel like that maybe that's a pirate channel thing,

177
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,300
and a Chevy update.

178
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,940
So there's those three things that I've been seeing.

179
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,940
The Chevy, the 1963 Chevy C10 is finally done.

180
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:49,100
And I say finally because Howard put an ungodly amount

181
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,860
of work and love and blood and passion and tears

182
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,860
into this truck to make it the smoothest, nicest ride

183
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,900
I have ever experienced driving a vehicle.

184
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,020
So the high score still needs to be beat.

185
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,380
That's, we'll probably be part of the office tour

186
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,220
if I do it.

187
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,100
Let me know, let me hear your thoughts.

188
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,220
Today, today is the first day of summer.

189
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,400
It's also my cousin's birthday, Willie.

190
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,040
I love ya, happy birthday.

191
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,980
I forgot his birthday once and he's never let me forget it.

192
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,980
He almost forgot mine once until my wife called him at 11.58.

193
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,020
She texted him and said, "Don't forget it's Pete's birthday."

194
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,180
He squeezed it in one minute before it was over

195
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,340
and I'm down one nothing to the point

196
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,900
I've actually tattooed his birthday on my wrist

197
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,740
so I would never forget again.

198
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,740
I just, I would love for him to forget mine.

199
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,100
I don't know why I told you that.

200
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
He's had a huge involvement in this channel

201
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,560
behind the scenes with ideation, support, and inspiration,

202
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,740
so I just felt like it was important to give credit

203
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,580
where credit was due.

204
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,900
A ghostwriter, if you will.

205
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,580
Everybody leave a comment, happy birthday Willie,

206
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,100
and then leave a little paramedic sign or something

207
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,040
because he saves lives.

208
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,780
That's what he does for a living.

209
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,820
Insane.

210
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,540
I'm hanging more neons tomorrow because this isn't enough.

211
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,940
I keep looking at this and I think, more.

212
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,740
And it's getting out of hand.

213
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,680
Just a quick update, saying hi,

214
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,900
letting you know that I'm still here.

215
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,700
I'm still very much working in the background,

216
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,780
behind the scenes.

217
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,520
But like I said at the beginning of the year,

218
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,340
in the video titled You Might Be Seeing Less of Me,

219
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,340
that was the truth.

220
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,500
I've been trying to figure out a way

221
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,460
to communicate my art in a different manner

222
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,640
that isn't necessarily three times a week,

223
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,000
the same vlogs you've seen for the last five,

224
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,480
six years now on YouTube,

225
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,200
I wanted to just have a different approach to video making

226
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,660
and that was, in fact, slowing down.

227
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,080
So I don't know that we'll continue that slow

228
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,760
for the rest of the year now that we're kind of

229
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,440
almost at a halfway point,

230
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,820
but I feel like a video like this was important for me

231
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,160
to just let you know that I'm still here,

232
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,120
I still love you, I still care about you,

233
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
I still care about this channel,

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
I love it more than I ever have.

235
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,260
That love for creating only grows bigger.

236
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,540
Plus, you should come see my coffee shop and pirate shop.

237
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,240
There's a retail space.

238
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,660
Like it's, we made a pirate store.

239
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,740
It's cool.

240
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,600
That's good coffee.

241
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,560
That's it for me guys.

242
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,440
Thanks so much for watching.

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,800

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,720

248
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,680
And then I'll just undo this little thing here

249
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,340
and I'll just close up the lens nice and quick.

250
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,180
Ready?
